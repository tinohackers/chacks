            PAUL FREEDMAN: Today
        we're going to talk about the transformation of the
        Roman Empire.And I use the somewhat neutral
        and undramatic word "transformation." It can be
        "fall of the Roman Empire,""collapse of the Roman
        Empire..." It's clear thatwe're talking about the fall
        of the Western Empire.Next week we'll talk
        about the survival of the Eastern Empire.From 410 to 480, the Western
        Roman Empire disintegrated.It was dismembered by barbarian
        groups who were, except for the Huns, not
        really very barbarian.That is, they were not intent
        on mayhem and destruction.All they really wanted to do was
        to be part of the Empire, to share in its wealth and
        accomplishments, rather than to destroy it.Nevertheless, 476 is the
        conventional date for the end of the Western Empire, because
        in that year, a barbarian chieftain deposed
        a Roman emperor.Nothing very new about this
        for the fifth century.What was new is that this
        chieftain, whose name is spelled all sorts of different
        ways, but in Wickham, it's Odovacer.Sometimes he's known as Odacaer,
        Odovacar, Odovacer.We aren't even sure
        what so-called tribe he belonged to.A barbarian general deposed
        the child emperor Romulus Augustulus, who by an
        interesting coincidence, has the names of both the founder
        of the city of Rome and the founder of the Roman Empire.The "-us" on the
        end is little.It's a diminutive.So a man with this grandiose
        name, a child, deposed in 476.And instead of imposing another
        emperor, Odovacer simply wrote to Constantinople
        and said, "We're going to be loyal to you.We will recognize you as the
        sole emperor." Constantinople,however, was far away.And while of symbolic
        significance, this pledge of loyalty by Odovacer had no
        practical significance.For all intents and purposes,
        the Western Empire had, in 476, become a collection
        of barbarian kingdoms.A kingdom is smaller
        than an empire.We use the term empire to mean
        a multi-national, very large state ruled from one center,
        but consisting of many different kinds of pieces.Kings, and the term and title
        "king", is of German origin.Kings are very powerful, but
        over a more limited territory.So there was a king
        of Italy now.There would be a king of the
        Franks, or Francia, the former Roman Gaul.There would be a king
        of the Lombards later in northern Italy.A king of the Visigoths, first
        in southern France and Spain.And we'll go over who
        is where at the beginning of next class.For now, we're going to talk
        about this collapse and its consequences.And we're going to
        orient ourselves around three big questions.One-- why did the west fall apart? And as a corollary to that
        question, was this because of the external pressure of
        invasions or the internal problems of institutional
        decline.Did it fall of its own
        accord or was it pushed, in other words? Question number two.Or big question number two.Who were these barbarians? And how Romanised or how
        different from Rome were they? And that's what we're going to
        talk about more on Wednesday, next class.And three, does this
        transformation mark a gradual shift to another civilization,
        or is it the cataclysmic end of the prevailing form of
        civilization, ushering in a prolonged period of what used
        to be called The Dark Ages? The Dark Ages-- roughly the sixth to
        eleventh century.This is a term we don't
        like to use.It implies a value judgment
        that is not only not necessarily accurate, but also
        expresses a certain kind of point of view of what are good
        periods in history and what are bad periods in history.But I'd like to just probe this
        third question first.That is, how severe a
        catastrophe was this? So is it the end of
        civilization, a la Planet of the Apes or Blade Runner, or
        any of those apocalyptic images we have? Or is it merely a shift in
        power and the survival of Roman institutions such as the
        Church, while Roman political infrastructure-- the emperor, the consoles, the
        pratorian prefects, and so forth-- while that collapses? A medieval historian named Roger
        Collins in a book called The Early Middle Ages writes,
        "The fall of the Roman Empire in the west was not the
        disappearance of a civilization.It was merely the breakdown of
        a governmental apparatus that could no longer be sustained."
        The key word here is "merely."The destruction of the Roman
        political apparatus may simply mean that the Roman state ceased
        to function, but that everything else continued.But really, the question is,
        could everything else continue in the absence of a state and
        of a political order? The destruction of the political
        order also means, after all, the destruction
        of the military system.When we opened this class, we
        talked about a civilization built on such things as the
        rule of law and the maintenance of peace.These are no longer possible
        if there is no military governmental structure.As we'll say a little later, to
        some extent people didn't know that it was the end.Because for a while, things
        seemed to go on as before.People were speaking Latin, they
        were living in cities, the cities were much less
        populated, but nevertheless, they were still there; there
        were still rich people; there were still poor people.In retrospect, though,
        we can see that things really did change.How much they changed is the
        subject of a lot of historical controversy.The world of the late Roman
        historians is divided, roughly speaking, between catastrophists
        and continuists.As you may guess, the
        catastrophists think the fall of the Roman Empire--, whether
        we date it 476 or there's some reasons to date it, really,
        550 for reasons we'll learn in next week.Between 450 and 550, a
        catastrophe happened.A civilization was wiped out.And really, if not literally a
        Dark Ages, a more primitive, more war-like, more illiterate,
        and more rural period was ushered in.The disappearance of ancient
        texts, things that the Romans knew from that lost Hortensius
        dialogue of Cicero that Augustine was so fond of, to
        many other kinds of works that had been known to the
        Roman world, right? I can't remember exactly how
        many plays Aeschylus wrote, but it's something
        on the order of 60, and we have three.So the disappearance of text.The end of literacy, except for
        a very small portion of the Christian clergy.A more primitive architecture.The end of grand civic projects
        like aqueducts, coliseums, theaters, baths.A more isolated society without
        these urban centers.A diminished population spread
        across the countryside, mostly engaged in subsistence.Hence, the, if not end
        of trade, the radical diminution of trade.The continuists, people like
        Collins whom I just quoted, see the political changes as
        dramatic all right, but as essentially surface phenomena
        based partly on archaeology and partly on a more sympathetic
        understanding of Christian practices.In other words, they don't think
        that the proliferation of churches, saints, cults,
        is necessarily a sign of a primitiveness.So based on both archaeology
        and an understanding of Christianity, these continuists
        point to the survival of trade, the role of
        bishops and other church officials, as replacing
        the Roman governors.The Roman political order may
        have collapsed in terms of staffing by lay people and
        military people, but the bishops were now the
        rulers of the city.The bishops would now do things
        like ensure the food supply, rally the local
        population against barbarian invasions, educate
        the populace.And the barbarian kings
        themselves try, with some success, to perpetuate
        the Roman order.They collect taxes,
        for example-- that may or may not
        be a good thing.They engage in some kind of
        public works, some kind of maintenance of order.The civilization of the sixth
        and seventh centuries in what comes to be considered Western
        Europe, rather than the Western Roman Empire, is not
        radically more barbarized or primitive than the late
        Roman Empire.Thus, the continuists.My own position, but I don't
        hold to it dogmatically, is that of a moderate
        catastrophist. I thinksomething really happened; I
        think it's pretty radical; and it didn't happen all
        at once, however.476 is not the year
        of collapse.It is a process.I'm fascinated by the degree to
        which people were and were not aware of the cataclysm,
        but I believe there is a cataclysm.Wickham, the author of this book
        that we're starting now The Inheritance of Rome, Chris
        Wickham, straddles the fence, as you've seen.His chapter that you were to
        read for today is entitled, "Crisis and Continuity: 400 to
        550." I would never use achapter title like that,
        because it's really frustrating.Which is it, dude? He's the leading medieval
        historian in the English - speaking world.He is Chichele Professor
        at All Souls, Oxford.And if that doesn't sound
        impressive, well, it takes a lot to impress you.He's a very great historian,
        but I don't like that chapter title.As I said, I would emphasize
        crisis or change cataclysm.Well, let's ask what happened,
        beginning with the gradual involvement of the barbarians
        in the military and their entrance into the empire.We're using the term
        "barbarians", which goes back to the Greek term applied
        to outsiders.People outside but
        threatening.The Greeks defined barbarians
        as uncivilized by reason of their speech, which sounded to
        them incoherent, and by reason of the fact that
        they're nomads.People who lead settled lives
        don't trust nomads.Nomads almost extinct in our
        world, once dominated many geographical regions and were
        frightening, because they moved to around to people who
        liked order and familiarity.They didn't live in cities,
        whether they were nomadic or not.Barbarians were illiterate.This is the Greek idea
        of barbarians.In the case of Rome, there is
        no single definition of barbarian society.We can say that Rome was
        overthrown by a war-like, but not very fierce, group
        of enemies.And I use enemies in
        a very mild sense.The Romans perceived them as
        enemies; the barbarians perceived Rome as simply
        a nicer place to live.But there is no Mongol horde
        kind of event here.They're not that frightening.The Romans had known
        them for centuries.Most of them were even
        Christians Heretical Christians, OK.They're Arians, A-R-I-A-N-S, I
        remind you, but they're not unfamiliar, again, even
        in their religion.They've been at the borders of
        the Roman empire forever.Like most empires, Rome was at
        the one hand, very aggressive, and on the other hand thought
        of itself is peace-loving.It maintained the Danube-Rhine
        frontier as a kind of natural frontier, every so often
        crossing those rivers to punish German tribes who
        were probing the frontiers of the empire.But generally speaking, the
        Romans were not interested in what they perceived, somewhat
        inaccurately, as endless forests inhabited by
        primitive people.The continuists argue, with some
        justice, that between 250 and 600 what changed was not
        that primitive warriors conquered a civilized state,
        in the way that say, the Mongols conquered China in the
        thirteenth century, but that the ancient world became
        the medieval world.That is, an urban culture
        became more rural.A Latin culture became
        amalgamated to a German one.Pagan society became
        Christian.Having said this, it's
        nevertheless true that the most dramatic event to the fifth
        century is that people who had been outside the
        empire were now in it.If we ask why the Western Empire
        collapsed, the simple, most immediate answer is it
        was taken over by German confederations, tribes.They came not so much as
        conquerors as military recruits, or as allies,
        or as refugees.So rather than as guys with
        knives in their teeth hacking and slashing and burning, they
        came as pathetic refugees, maybe doing some hacking,
        slashing, and burning; as military recruits; and
        as military allies.Again, not without a certain
        amount of H. S. B.: hackingand slashing and burning.But not a cataclysmic amount.They admired Rome.They wanted to continue
        its institutions.They regarded Rome as a
        rich and as civilized.The last thing they wanted was
        to still live in little huts in the forest.They were not the bringers
        of a revolution.They were not even that
        numerous, amounting to some tens of thousands.Nevertheless, they ended Roman
        government, accelerated the changes we've already
        described towards depopulation, decentralization, ruralization-- a less cultivated, less
        literate, less Mediterranean- centered society.So I want to begin the
        description of this process by the changes in the Roman army.We saw that Diocletian, around
        300 AD, militarizes Roman government, pays for the,
        perhaps, doubling of the military presence of the
        Roman army by changing the taxation system.So the twin pillars of the
        empire in the fourth century are army and taxation, the
        latter requiring a civilian governmental apparatus.The army was a problem
        in terms of the recruiting of soldiers.This may have to do with the
        population; it may have to do with the unattractive nature
        of military life, but nevertheless there was already,
        in the fourth century, a tendency to get the
        more familiar barbarians into the army as Roman soldiers.Because they were available,
        they were near the frontiers-- this may seem odd.Why hire your potential
        enemy to be soldiers? But there's a lot
        of precedent.Very often, empires don't really
        want to supply their own manpower.And the people who are the best
        soldiers are also the people who may, in the future,
        be most threatening.I don't want to pursue this
        simile, but the Afghan Mujahidiee were trained by
        Americans, because at one time they were opposed to the
        Russian occupation of Afghanistan.As it happened, in retrospect,
        that had some bad consequences.But at the time, it seemed
        like a good idea.So in the 370s a group called
        the Visigoths asks to be admitted to the Roman Empire
        as an allied army.In other words, the whole group
        will be federated with the Romans.And federati is the term given
        for barbarian troops serving under the Roman Empire.Why were they on the move? These are not really
        nomadic people.They don't live in yurts or
        travel across Central Asia.They tend to be settled
        in villages.They have dairy cattle rather
        than have some kind of nomadic sheep, or something like.They're pretty settled.Nevertheless, in 378, they
        were on the move.And we don't know why.Some enemy pushing them
        across the Danube into what's now Romania? It may be the weakness
        of the Empire.They may have seen that the
        empire was not so strong and made a proposition, kind
        of like a takeover.You don't seem to be doing so
        well in your stock or your finances, so we're going to
        infuse some capital into you, i.e., our soldiers.They also may have
        been hungry.Certainly, once they crossed the
        frontier, the Romans were rather inept in feeding them,
        in supplying them, and the Visigoths rebelled.Thus far, nothing
        incredibly new.What really was new was that the
        emperor came with an army to suppress them.And rather to his surprise and
        everybody else's, the emperor Valens was defeated at the
        battle of Adrianopole.Defeated by the barbarians.Yeah.STUDENT: So, being involved in
        this federati, what did they get from the Roman Empire? Did they agree to fight for them
        and then they'd get land? PROFESSOR: They
        agreed to fight for them and they got a combination of land,
        or supposed to get land or territory, and some
        kind of maintenance in kind and or money.The question was about what the
        Visigoths, as federati, got out of this deal.Or were supposed to get.The defeat at Valens was not
        immediately cataclysmic, because, even though he was
        killed at this battle, even though it sent shock waves
        throughout the empire, in fact, it would not be this area
        that succumbed to the barbarians--, the East. Romania,
        or the Balkans wouldbe part of the Eastern Empire.And indeed, both Adrianople the
        city, and Constantinople, the even greater city, would
        withstand Visigothic attempts to take them.In 382, the Visigoths were
        officially recognized, and they were allowed to settle in
        the Balkans as federati.And in fact, they were
        reasonably useful troops to the Roman Empire in
        the 380s and 390s.What this does show,
        however, is the barbarization of the army.And another aspect of that is
        that the army tended to be commanded now more and more
        by barbarian generals.These barbarian generals, at
        the top, bore the title magister militum-- master of the soldiers.So I'm using the term "general"
        as an anachronistic one, since that's what
        we're familiar with.These magistri were powerful
        leaders, charismatic leaders, of German or other tribal
        groups, who then ruled in the name of, or behind the throne
        of the emperor.They couldn't be emperors
        themselves, at least in these years, it was impossible to
        envisage a barbarian emperor.But they held more power
        than the emperors.Two of these generals, war
        leaders, magistri, Stilicho and Alaric.Stilicho was a Vandal Alaric
        was a Visigoth.Alaric wanted territory, food,
        treasure from Rome.The Visigoths were moving from
        the Balkans into Greece, eventually into Italy.Stilicho played a kind of game
        with Alaric, trying to keep him in check in the name of the
        Western emperor, but also negotiating with him.The emperors moved from Milan
        in the north to Ravenna, a little bit to the east. Ravenna,
        then, was in themarshes and impossible for
        a barbarian army to take.This is the last capital of
        the Western Roman Empire.Kind of romantic and mysterious,
        but strange as a place to end up.These are the Visigoths then,
        who are on the move in the 390s and the 400s.Eventually, Stilicho would be
        executed by the Roman emperor of the West and Alaric
        would invade and plunder Rome in 410.It was the Visigoths who
        engineered the so-called Sack of Rome that so shocked
        Augustine and his contemporaries.Where, you might be asking
        in all of this, was the Roman army? Alaric was wandering around the
        Balkans and Italy for two decades before he sacked Rome.The army, which had consumed
        so much of the resources of the Roman Empire, is curiously
        absent in the history of the fifth century.This is not the Eastern
        Front in World War II.This is something altogether
        different: the collapse of an empire that expended
        huge amounts of treasure on its army.Its army seems to be invisible
        and supports, to some extent, or that fact supports to some
        extent--, the argument that the Roman Empire collapsed of
        its own internal disorders, since we don't see it losing
        pitched battles to outside barbarians.Or maybe the army doesn't
        disappear, it becomes indistinguishable from
        the invaders.The army is the invaders.Creepier.Now within this, there are
        some real barbarians-- the Huns.The Huns are kind of nomadic.OK, they didn't actually cook
        their meat by holding it between their thigh and the
        horse hide, and the sweat and heat of the horse heated
        up the meat.This is a widespread myth
        of nomadic peoples.The Chinese say this about
        the Mongols, the Romans about Huns.But they were pretty mean.They were interested
        in the Roman Empire mostly for plunder.And they didn't care if that
        destroyed the economic base, because they weren't thinking
        in such terms. And indeed,they may have frightened the
        rather nice German tribes that stood between them and
        the Roman Empire.In the 450s the Huns were
        united under the leadership of Attila.And Attila certainly threatened
        the Eastern Empire first, but the Eastern emperor
        defeated the Huns, discontinued tribute to them,
        and in a pattern that we'll see repeated again and again,
        the Huns decided that Constantinople was too tough.That the Eastern Empire as a
        whole, access to which was more or less controlled
        by Constantinople, was too well guarded.And they turned to
        the west instead.Not as rich maybe, but
        much easier pickings.They show up in Gaul in 450.They were defeated
        by an army of Visigoths allied with Romans.They then went to Italy.They went into the heart of the
        Empire, sacked cities in the northeast of Italy,
        and there's no army.The emperor is holed
        up in Ravenna.basically shuts the door, gets
        under the bed, and waits for it to go away.The one power of Italy willing
        to try to deal with Attila is the Bishop of Rome, whom we
        haven't heard of yet, but we're going to be hearing
        about him a lot.And indeed, in the course that
        follows this, even more.The Bishop of Rome-- the pope.Pope Leo I, along with two
        senators from the Roman senate, goes up to northern
        Italy to remonstrate with Attila, to visit the leader of
        this barbarian tribe in 453 to try to get him to stop
        plundering Italy.Whether they were successful
        or not doesn't much matter, because Attila died shortly
        thereafter of a brain hemorrhage.And with his charismatic
        leadership, the Huns came to an end as a military force.That is, with the end of his
        leadership, the Huns no longer had as imposing a military
        force and quickly disintegrated.What's significant is that it's
        the pope who is taking over what we would think of
        as the Roman imperial responsibilities.And this will be a pattern, not
        only in the assertion of papal power, but in the way in
        which the Church starts to take over many of the roles
        abandoned by the empire.After this, the barbarian
        generals, in effect, take charge.The Huns are defeated, but
        the other groups now pour into the empire.The Vandals have taken over
        North Africa by this time, by 430, cutting off the grain
        supply to Rome.They are unusual among the
        barbarian groups in that they have a navy.They know how to use boats, and
        indeed, they plunder the city of Rome in 455 in a sack
        that might have been worse than that of 410.By 470, the Visigoths control
        southern Gaul, what's now southern France; a group called
        the Suevi are in Spain; the Vandals in North Africa; a
        group called the Ostrogoths in what's now Hungary; the Angles
        and the Saxons in Britain.All that effectively remained
        of the Western empire when Odovacer overthrew Romulus
        Augustulus was Italy.And in 476, that's it.A little coda, however.In 493, the Eastern emperor in
        Constantinople convinced the Ostrogoths to get out of
        Hungary, stop threatening the Eastern Empire, and take
        Italy from Odovacer.Once again, the Eastern Empire
        is capable of deflecting barbarians into the west,
        because they're too strong.So in 493, our friend Odovacer
        was overthrown by the Ostrogoths and their
        leader Theoderic.So what's the impact
        of all of this? On the ground, if you were
        looking around in 480s 490s, you would see a kind
        of accommodation.The Roman elite accommodated
        themselves to, compromised with, negotiated with,
        their new rulers.So, for example, a member of a
        very wealthy Roman family, a man named Sidonius Apollinaris
        in southern France, was a bishop and a great landowner.And we have a lot of letters of
        his that tell us about his negotiations with the Visigothic
        king Euric.He found the Vsigoths uncouth,
        hard to deal with, not knowledgeable of the Latin
        classics, but not very frightening, either.Not particularly formidable.So accommodation,
        improvisation.We have a saint's life that
        is a biography of a saint, a man named-- I'm sorry that I'm writing on
        the board so much today.Usually, as you know, I'm a
        little more in control.But these are great names.And some of them are good cats
        names or dog names, too.Severinus of Noricum.You know, "Stop scratching the
        furniture, Severinus." Thatkind of thing.Severinus of Noricum.A saint in what's now, more
        or less, Austria.His life tells us that he
        learned of the end of the Roman Empire this way: "At the time when the Roman
        Empire was still in existence, the soldiers of many towns were
        supported by public money to guard the frontier.When this arrangement ceased,
        the military formations were dissolved, and the frontier
        vanished.The garrison of Passau, which
        is still a town in modern Bavaria, the garrison
        of Passau, however, still held out.Some of the men had gone to
        Italy to fetch for their comrades their last payment."This resembles a corporation-- somebody, actually, was telling
        me yesterday they worked for Eastern Airlines,
        a company that went out of business in 1990.And so sudden was the collapse
        of Eastern, even though it had been predicted, that she was a
        flight attendant and had to get on another airline
        in order to get home.She lived in New York; she was
        in Florida; Eastern ceased to exist. So these soldiers are
        in the same position.They want to get their
        last paycheck.They were never heard
        from again.Nobody knew that they, in
        fact, were killed by barbarians on the way."One day, when Saint Severinus
        was reading in his cell, he suddenly closed the book
        and began to sigh.The river, he said, was now
        red with human blood.At that moment the news arrived
        that the soldiers had been washed ashore
        by the current."Interestingly enough, he
        doesn't just stay in his cell and pray.He starts to organize
        this society.He is active, although some of
        it involves some miracles, in poor relief.He deals with the local
        barbarian king, the king of the Alamanni, remonstrates
        with him.He helps in diverting
        Odovacer into Italy.Again, like Pope Leo, we have a
        member of the church, and in this case somebody that you
        would think was a recluse, indeed had been living like a
        recluse, nevertheless taking over the responsibilities for a
        population abandoned by its civilian government.That is then one of the forms
        of accommodation.Another aspect of this era,
        however, is decline.The urban population declines.The society and economy
        experienced what Wickham euphemistically calls,
        "a radical material simplification." The term
        he uses, I believe,on page 95 and 105."Radical material
        simplification" means that your standard of living
        plummets.Cruder ceramics.Instead of that nice, north
        African red slip ware, you've got mud that you
        baked at home.Fewer imports, no pepper.More homemade, crude
        building materials.Fewer luxury goods.The Vandal control of North
        Africa meant the end of the Roman wheat supply.The countryside of Rome had not
        grown enough wheat to feed the city since 200 BC.So for 600 years, minimum, Rome
        was dependent on other sources of supply.Southern Italy, Sicily,
        North Africa.The moment the Vandals cut the
        supply, the city could no longer support its massive
        population, could not feed everybody.When you multiply this
        phenomenon, it's not a surprise that the city's decline
        in population, and that the society becomes more
        rural, more agricultural, more subsistent And here's where I think Collins
        is naive to speak of merely a political decline.Without a government and
        military structure, trade could not take place on the
        scale it had before.And without that trade, cities
        could not survive.There is no denying a decline
        in culture, economy, and population.Let's just look at Roman
        population figures, based on things like pork supply figures,
        public-- well, I mean, nobody took a
        census in Rome.We don't really know exactly how
        many people lived there at any given time.But historians and
        archaeologists looking at things like food supply, public
        welfare payments, water delivery figures, for aqueducts,
        and the abandonment of houses and of
        building sites.Probably in 5 BC, the Roman
        population was 800,000.That would be a fairly
        conservative estimate.Maybe as much as a million,
        but definitely 800,000.5 BC.Yeah? STUDENT: This is just
        the city of Rome? PROFESSOR:
        Just the city of Rome.Yes, just the city of Rome.At the time of Constantine,
        sort of where we begin the course, more or less, in the
        early fourth century, the population had declined
        probably to 600,000.After the sack of Rome in 419,
        probably 300,000 to 500,000.Obviously, these are
        very rough figures.But after the sack of Rome,
        more than half of the population that had existed
        in 5 BC is gone.With the end of grain shipments
        from North Africa, we don't really know
        immediately.We can estimate that by 590,
        there could not have been more than 150,000 people in Rome.This is after not only the
        Vandals, but after a catastrophic war in Italy
        launched by the Byzantine Emperor Justinian, who we'll
        be talking about next week.In 800, on Christmas Day,
        Charlemagne was crowned in Saint Peter's in Rome as Roman
        Emperor by the pope, an act whose implications we will
        be exploring towards the end of the class.On that day, Rome must've had
        maximum, maximum, most optimistic estimate,
        30,000 people.This does not necessarily mean
        that they were primitive, but they were living in the
        Coliseum, for example.People built houses in there.They used the walls of the
        Coliseum as a fort.There is a certain Planet of
        the Apes quality, in fact.Rome, still to this day, is
        filled with picturesque ruins, even though it is a city
        of two and a half, three million people.As I said, people were
        not necessarily aware of this change.For example, lots of churches
        were built at this time, and some of them have mosaic
        pavements that have mottos about the grandeur of the Roman
        name, and the usual classical kind of mottos.But then again, people often
        aren't aware of what's happening to them.I mean, what if somebody in the
        future points to the fact that New Haven, in 1920, had far
        more people living in it than it does now? New Haven lost a third
        of its population between 1950 and 1980.What if some future historian
        is scandalized at the fact that in order to get into Yale a
        hundred years ago you had to know Greek and Latin.If you look at what those
        gentlemen C Students had to study, or were responsible
        for, in say, 1925, it's extraordinary.It's not very impressive in the
        sciences, but the decline of the humanities, if by decline
        we mean things like knowledge of classical
        literature, is stunning.Somebody may decide in a few
        hundred years that the Dark Ages began in about 1950.And that those pathetic people
        in, say, 2011, impressed with their little technological
        toys, nonetheless didn't know
        anything.Now I don't actually
        believe that.There are some people who do.There's a philosopher at Notre
        Dame named Alasdair MacIntyre who really believes that the
        Dark Ages began a long time ago, and we simply don't know.We simply refuse to
        recognize this.I was impressed by an obituary
        for a man named Patrick Leigh Fermor, who died at the age
        of 96 earlier this year.This is the last of the great
        British characters of the twentieth century.He not only was classically
        trained, wrote a lot about Greece, lived in Greece, he, in
        World World II, disguised himself as a Greek shepherd in
        Crete, engineered the capture of a German general, and the
        delivery of that general after three weeks of hiking through
        the mountains of Crete to a British destroyer.It's in a movie called Ill Met
        By Moonlight, if you ever want to check this out.Not a great movie, but-- Patrick Leigh Fermor also
        wrote two books out of a projected three about walking
        from Holland to Constantinople or, Baghdad actually, I
        think, in the 1930s.But the obituary describes a
        conversation he had with this German general, whom he is
        trying to get across Crete.And the general at one point,
        over some fire in the wilderness, quotes a line from
        Horace, the Roman poet, that then Patrick Leigh Fermor
        finishes is for him, and indeed, quotes the
        next two stanzas.Well, that world is over.That world is over.I don't pretend to be part
        of that world, either.And that's a world that would
        have existed in the time of Horace, or the years after
        Horace, who lives at the time of Augustus.This would have existed in 300 A
        D. It would have existed, atleast, in a few monasteries
        in 800 AD.It would have flourished in the
        Britain of the eighteenth and nineteenth and early
        twentieth centuries.So again, I don't think that
        civilization came to an end.What came to an end was a
        civilization, a certain kind of society.It has some heirs, however,
        like all dead entities.There are four heirs to
        the Roman Empire.One is the Byzantine Empire,
        the Eastern Roman Empire, which calls itself
        the Roman Empire.It doesn't call itself the
        Eastern, doesn't call itself the Byzantine, it calls itself
        the Roman Empire, even though it does so in Greek.The second heir are the
        barbarian kings.We'll be talking about
        them on Wednesday.They are attempting to prop up
        the remnants of Roman culture, civilization, and material
        society.The third heir in some ways, is
        Islam, which we meet in the seventh century, the century
        of its invention.And the fourth heir
        is the Church.Even though the Church grew up
        in opposition to the Roman Empire, it will preserve Latin,
        cities, learning, classical civilization.OK.So barbarians on Wednesday.
